✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve cometa-api`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Migrations

This command does two things:

- It creates a new SQL migration file for this migration
- It runs the SQL migration file against the database

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Whenever you update your Prisma schema, you will have to update your database schema using either:

```
npx prisma db seed  // explicitly seeds the database

npx prisma migrate reset  --skip-seed  // resest data in tables withtout running seeds
npx prisma migrate reset  // deletes data in tables and seeds the database again

npx prisma migrate dev  // creates and runs migrations and also seeds the database
npx prisma migrate dev  --skip-seed  // does not seed the database

npx prisma db push   // pushes prisma schemma changes to the database

yarn add sharp --ignore-engines
```

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
