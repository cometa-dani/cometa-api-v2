Here are the steps you can follow to build your social network app:

1. **Implement the Backend Logic:**

   - You can use Node.js and Express.js for building the backend of your application. Prisma will help you interact with the database efficiently. Implement the logic for user authentication, creating events, managing friendships, likes, matches, and handling notifications.

2. **Create API Endpoints:**

   - Define RESTful or GraphQL API endpoints to allow clients (web, mobile) to interact with your backend. Implement routes and controllers for user registration, login, event creation, liking events, sending friend requests, and more.

3. **Frontend Development:**

   - Develop the user interfaces for your app using technologies like React for web or React Native for mobile. Use the API endpoints to retrieve and display data. Implement user registration, login, event listing, and user profiles.

4. **Authentication and Authorization:**

   - Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to different parts of your app. You can use tokens or sessions for this purpose.

5. **Real-time Features:**

   - For real-time features like chat or notifications, consider using technologies like WebSockets, or you can explore tools like Pusher or WebSocket libraries.

6. **Testing:**

   - Thoroughly test your application to ensure it functions correctly. Unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing are essential.

7. **Deployment:**

   - Deploy your backend and frontend to a hosting platform of your choice. For the backend, you can use cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Vercel. The frontend can be hosted on services like Netlify or Vercel for web apps or on mobile app stores for mobile apps.

8. **User Feedback and Iteration:**

   - After deployment, gather user feedback and iterate on your app based on user suggestions and bug reports.

9. **Scale and Optimize:**
   - As your app grows, consider optimizing your database queries, improving performance, and scaling your infrastructure to handle more users.

Remember that building a social networking app is a complex task, and it requires careful planning and execution. It's also important to consider privacy and security features, as well as compliance with data protection regulations if applicable.

Good luck with your project! If you have specific questions or need guidance on any part of the development process, feel free to ask.
