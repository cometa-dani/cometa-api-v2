    Yes, when specifying the route for the API endpoint in your client-side JavaScript,
    you should provide the relative path starting with a forward slash `/`.
    This means you do not need to include the entire URL with the host because
    the browser will automatically use the current host as the base.

  For example, if your Express.js server is
  running locally on `http://localhost:3000`, and you define
  the route as `/api/yourEndpoint`, the client-side JavaScript
  will automatically make a request to `http://localhost:3000/api/yourEndpoint`.

  Using the relative path makes it more flexible,
  as it adapts to the current environment (local development, staging, production)
  without having to change the URL each time. However, in a production environment,
  you may need to specify the full URL when making requests to external APIs or services.
